Changelog

0.1.0:
    * Rewrite of original nrc module.

0.2.0:
    * Module system added.

0.3.0:
    * Removal of the Protocols dependency. There's no logging at the moment.
    * Modules are moved to their own object.
    * BiSubscriber handlers the subscribing of events to either the
      IRCMessageEmitter or the IRCCommandEmitter.
    * Default NRC Modules are disabled (until the next version)

0.4.0:
    * Event listeners are no longer bound to 'nrc'.
    * Message and Command objects use 'args' instead of 'params/parameters'.
      This follows the same naming convention that node-irc uses.
    * Default NRC Modules are refactored so that they return a function that
      returns a module.
    * ModuleSubscriber.requires() interface contract changed so that it takes
      a one-arg constructor (that arg being the NRC object for the server the
      module will be on) that returns a module.
    * Module contract gains additional optional field for dependencies:
        + dependencies(undefined U ModuleExports): List[String] U undefined
    * Only the server module works.

0.4.1:
    * Added a new test for Message Handlers.

0.4.2: (Unreleased)
    * Renamed classes.
    * Added an IrcOutputSocket class. NRC absorbs it of course.
    * Added everything to the index.
    * Got Dependency Injection for all non-structure objects.
    * Added `userhost` method to IrcOutputSocket/NRC.

0.4.3:
    * Nrc class renamed to Client.
    * `whois` method added to IrcOutputSocket/Client
    * Moved startup stuff from IrcMessageHandler to Client.
    ** Removed config parameter from its constructor. :)
    * Testing of 'say', 'part', and 'quit' of the IrcOutputSocket.
    ** Feel free to add more tests!

0.4.4:
    * Made dependency injection argument of Client optional.
    * Started the ChunkedMessageParser. Not working.

0.5.0:
    * Moved module system to its own project.
    * Module system completely revamped.
    * Module loading via name and tennu_modules directory-tree climb.

0.5.2:
    * Require 1.0.1 of simple-irc-socket for logging.

0.5.3:
    * Fix this._name() doesn't exist in CommandParser

0.6.0:
    * Add .out and .events to Client
    * IMPORTANT! Froze .args on Command and Message
      If you were mutating these without cloning, you'll need to change your code.
    * Get the Help module working again. With tests this time.

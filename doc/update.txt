From v.0.4.x to v.0.6.x:

    If you have any modules, you'll probably have to rewrite them completely.
    Sorry.

From v.0.5.x to v.0.6.x:

    Message and Command objects have property name changes to align with the
    irc-message module.

    In Message, the following property changes occurred:

    * args -> params
    * sender -> hostmask
    ** hostmask properties have "name" added to the end of it.
    * actor -> nickname
    * name -> command

    For Nickname Messages:

    * newNick -> new

    For Command objects

    * name -> command

From v.0.6.x to v.0.7.x:

    Client.nick()'s nullary functionality (of returning the current nickname)
    has been deprecated, and will be removed in v.0.8.x. Instead, use
    Client.nickname().

    The unary version of Client.nick(newNick) will still be available.

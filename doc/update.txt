From v.0.4.x to v.0.6.x:

    If you have any modules, you'll probably have to rewrite them completely.
    Sorry.

From v.0.5.x to v.0.6.x:

    Message and Command objects have property name changes to align with the
    irc-message module.

    In Message, the following property changes occurred:

    * args -> params
    * sender -> hostmask
    ** hostmask properties have "name" added to the end of it.
    * actor -> nickname
    * name -> command

    For Nickname Messages:

    * newNick -> new

    For Command objects

    * name -> command

From v.0.6.x to v.0.7.x:

    Client.nick()'s nullary functionality (of returning the current nickname)
    has been deprecated, and will be removed in v.0.8.x. Instead, use
    Client.nickname().

    The unary version of Client.nick(newNick) is unchanged.

    The idea is that a method should do one thing, and this one currently does two.


    You now have access to eight logging levels (debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, alert, error).
    Use them as needed.

    You may need to pass a Logger to your Client. If so, I suggest using Winston.
